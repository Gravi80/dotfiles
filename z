A script that makes navigating in the terminal much faster.

brew install z

Once you've installed it, add the following to your .zshrc (including the . at the beginning).

. `brew --prefix`/etc/profile.d/z.sh


Instead of doing cd ~/Somefolder/Anotherfolder/project/, you can just do z proj.

It keeps track of your cd to directories in a file called ~/.z - Once you've cd'd into a directory once, you can use z to navigate to it.
